To create Postman documentation for this code, you can follow these steps:

1. *Create a new collection:*
   Open Postman and create a new collection to organize your requests.

2. *Add requests to the collection:*
   - Create a request for each endpoint in your code (GET /, GET /hall/details, GET /hall/details/:id, POST /hall/details, PUT /hall/details/:id, GET /booked/halls, GET /customer/details).
   - Use the appropriate HTTP method for each request.

3. *Add request details:*
   - For each request, add relevant details in the request configuration.
   - Include request parameters, headers, and request body where applicable.

4. *Document request-response examples:*
   - Include sample requests and responses for each endpoint in your documentation.
   - Highlight any required parameters or headers.

5. *Document the data model:*
   - Document the structure of the data expected in request bodies and the format of the data returned in responses.
   - Provide examples of the data model.

6. *Document error handling:*
   - Include information on possible error responses and their meanings.
   - Specify the status codes and error messages returned.

7. *Add explanations:*
   - Add explanations for each endpoint, describing its purpose and usage.
   - Provide any additional information developers might need to understand and use the API effectively.

8. *Organize and structure:*
   - Organize your documentation logically, grouping similar requests together.
   - Use sections and headings to structure your documentation.

9. *Include a base URL:*
   - Specify the base URL for your API (e.g., http://localhost:9000).

10. *Test your requests:*
    - Test each request to ensure it behaves as expected.
    - Confirm that the responses match your documented examples.

11. *Publish your documentation:*
    - If you want to share your documentation, consider publishing it on a platform like Postman Cloud or generating a shareable link.

Remember to update your documentation if there are changes to your API.
